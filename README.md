# Photon Duality Simulator

## Quantum interference model simulator where a photon is modelled as either Bright or Dark state


This project simulates a novel quantum interference model where a photon is modeled as a superposition of:

- Bright states: Interact with detectors (observable).

- Dark states: Do not interact directly but still influence interference patterns.

The simulation numerically models how these components create interference, even when only part of the photon's wavefunction is measurable. This allows for deeper investigation into quantum measurement theory, hidden state dynamics, and alternative interpretations of wavefunction collapse.

Core Features

- Simulates spatial wavefunctions of bright and dark states

- Computes combined intensity profile

- Animates phase variation in dark states to show shifting interference fringes

- Modular for testing custom experimental setups

  
**To be added:**
 - decoherence models, 
 - detector interactions, 
 - entanglement support
